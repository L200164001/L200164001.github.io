<h1>SSD AND HDD</h1>
<p>1. SSD <br>An SSD (solid-state drive) is a type of nonvolatile storage media that stores persistent data on solid-state flash memory. Two key components make up an SSD: a flash controller and NAND flash memory chips. The architectural configuration of the SSD controller is optimized to deliver high read and write performance for both sequential and random data requests. SSDs are sometimes referred to as flash drives or solid-state disks.</p>
<p>2. HDD <br>A hard disk drive (HDD) is a non-volatile computer storage device containing magnetic disks or platters rotating at high speeds. It is a secondary storage device used to store data permanently, random access memory (RAM) being the primary memory device. Non-volatile means data is retained when the computer is turned off.</p><br>

SSD VS HDD COMPARISON
<table border=1>
<tr>
<td>Attribute</td>
<td>SSD (Solid State Drive)</td>
<td>HDD (Hard Disk Drive)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Power Draw / Battery Life</td>
<td>Less power draw, averages 2 – 3 watts, resulting in 30+ minute battery boost </td>
<td>More power draw,averages 6 – 7 watts and therefore uses more battery</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cost</td>
<td>Expensive, roughly $0.20 per gigabyte (based on buying a 1TB drive)</td>
<td>Only around $0.03 per gigabyte, very cheap (buying a 4TB model)</td>
</tr>
