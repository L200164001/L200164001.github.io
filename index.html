<h1>SSD AND HDD</h1>
<p>1. SSD <br>An SSD (solid-state drive) is a type of nonvolatile storage media that stores persistent data on solid-state flash memory. Two key components make up an SSD: a flash controller and NAND flash memory chips. The architectural configuration of the SSD controller is optimized to deliver high read and write performance for both sequential and random data requests. SSDs are sometimes referred to as flash drives or solid-state disks.</p>
<p>2. HDD <br>A hard disk drive (HDD) is a non-volatile computer storage device containing magnetic disks or platters rotating at high speeds. It is a secondary storage device used to store data permanently, random access memory (RAM) being the primary memory device. Non-volatile means data is retained when the computer is turned off.</p><br>

SSD VS HDD COMPARISON
<table border=1>
<tr>
<td>Attribute</td>
<td>SSD (Solid State Drive)</td>
<td>HDD (Hard Disk Drive)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Power Draw / Battery Life</td>
<td>Less power draw, averages 2 – 3 watts, resulting in 30+ minute battery boost </td>
<td>More power draw,averages 6 – 7 watts and therefore uses more battery</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cost</td>
<td>Expensive, roughly $0.20 per gigabyte (based on buying a 1TB drive)</td>
<td>Only around $0.03 per gigabyte, very cheap (buying a 4TB model)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Capacity</td>
<td>Typically not larger than 1TB for notebook size drives; 4TB max for desktops </td>
<td>Typically around 500GB and 2TB maximum for notebook size drives; 10TB max for desktops </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Operating System Boot Time</td>
<td>Around 10-13 seconds average bootup time </td>
<td>Around 30-40 seconds average bootup time</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Noise</td>
<td>There are no moving parts and as such no sound</td>
<td>Audible clicks and spinning can be heard</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vibration</td>
<td>No vibration as there are no moving parts</td>
<td>The spinning of the platters can sometimes result in vibration</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Heat Produced </td>
<td>Lower power draw and no moving parts so little heat is produced</td>
<td>HDD doesn’t produce much heat, but it will have a measurable amount more heat than an SSD due to moving parts and higher power draw</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Failure Rate</td>
<td>Mean time between failure rate of 2.0 million hours</td>
<td>Mean time between failure rate of 1.5 million hours </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>File Copy / Write Speed</td>
<td>Generally above 200 MB/s and up to 550 MB/s for cutting edge drives</td>
<td>The range can be anywhere from 50 – 120MB / s</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Encryption</td>
<td>Full Disk Encryption (FDE) Supported on some models</td>
<td>Full Disk Encryption (FDE) Supported on some models</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>File Opening Speed</td>
<td>Up to 30% faster than HDD</td>
<td>Slower than SSD</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Magnetism Affected?</td>
<td>An SSD is safe from any effects of magnetism</td>
<td>Magnets can erase data</td>
</tr>
